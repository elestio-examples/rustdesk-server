## Connecting to the Target Machine with Control Remote Desktop

To connect to the target machine, you need to construct a connection string as follows:
<user_id>@<server_address>?key=<public_key>

### Breakdown of the Connection String

1. **User ID**: The unique identifier for the user or machine you want to connect to.
2. **Server Address**: The address of the remote server hosting the RustDesk instance.
3. **Public Key**: The public key associated with the user or machine for authentication.

### Steps to Find Your Public Key

2. **Navigate to the Tools Tab**: Find and open the Tools tab within the Elestio dashboard.
3. **Open VSCode**: Select the button to open VSCode.
4. **Search for the Data Folder**: In VSCode, locate and open the 'data' folder.
5. **Locate the Public Key File**: Inside the 'data' folder, look for a file with the extension `.pub`. This file contains your public key.

### Example

Given the following details:

- **User ID**: `123456789`
- **Server Address**: `[CICD_DOMAIN]`
- **Public Key**: `TC5BjIDAV+mA0eI4biQuab3oAeRkagBUkPMBC8xJ610=`
